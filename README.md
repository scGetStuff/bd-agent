# bd-agent

boot.dev "Build an AI Agent" project

# To run
```shell
uv run main.py
```

# `.venv` note

- the instructions mentioned running `source .venv/bin/activate`, but that does not persist
- use command pallet `Python: Select Interpreter` and chose the venv to make it stick
- I also had to change a setting to activate on load `"python.terminal.activateEnvInCurrentTerminal": true`

# "Extending the Project" from the lesson

- Fix harder and more complex bugs
- Refactor sections of code
- Add entirely new features

You can also try:

- Other LLM providers
- Other Gemini models
- Giving it more functions to call
- Other codebases (Commit your changes before running the agent so you can always revert!)
