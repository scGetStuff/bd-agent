uv run main.py

# TODO

# `.venv` note

- the instructions mentioned running `source .venv/bin/activate`, but that does not persist
- use command pallet `Python: Select Interpreter` and chose the venv to make it stick
- I also had to change a setting to activate on load `"python.terminal.activateEnvInCurrentTerminal": true`
